		<h2>Serving Inmates</h2>
		<p>Each year we send thousands of books and resources free of charge to inmates who otherwise couldnâ€™t afford to buy them.</p>
		<p>These materials provide education and life skills as well as joy and relief to people in prison. We have recipients who have been with us for years and hear from new ones every week.</p>

		<h2>Providing a Support Line</h2>
		<p>Imprisoned people are underserved in every way imaginable. We view our work as a small but necessary way of counteracting the injustices of the incarceration system. Our goal is to provide resources that help people during their imprisonment and as they prepare to transition back to society.</p>
