intro: We are an all-volunteer 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded in 2006 that sends free books and resources to people in prisons across North Carolina and Alabama. We also send zines (booklets of free, printed material on a variety of subjects) across the country.

	<p>Our goal is to provide literature and radical resources to support incarcerated people as they navigate the violent and alienating institutions of the American Prison Industrial Complex. We send materials into prisons in order to encourage and materially support knowledge gathering and community building across walls designed to keep people apart. We will never forget those kept out of sight, and will always extend humanity to the dehumanized.</p>
	<p>We meet every Sunday as a group to fulfill requests and to package books to send to incarcerated people. We send to men incarcerated in North Carolina and anyone incarcerated in Alabama. (The NC Womenâ€™s Prison Book Project serves women in North Carolina.) In addition to sending books, we have an extensive catalog of zines (political, educational, artistic, and self-help) that we prepare and mail on request. We also publish Words of Fire, a semi-regular collection of art, short stories, essays, and poetry by incarcerated people. See our Resources page for more</p>
	<p class="italicized">If you know someone in prison who would be interested in receiving free books or resources, please share our flyer with them and ask them to send us a letter at PO Box 625, Carrboro, NC 27510!</p>
