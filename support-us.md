		<h2>Volunteer during workdays.</h2>
		<p>Because we work in a relatively small space, we are currently pausing guest volunteer visits as we weather the pandemic. We will post updates to our <a href="{{ site.facebook_link }}">Facebook page</a> about our volunteer policy as North Carolina moves into new quarantine phases. A core group of PBC volunteers, however, is continuing to meet each week to fulfill book requests. </p>

		<h2>Advocate prison reform.</h2>
		<p>We recognize that the work we do is helping people endure an unjust system, and that the work of reform requires advocacy on a state and national scale.</p>
		<p>Find organizations that provide fair legal representation, advocate for prisoners’ rights, and act as a bridge between the inside and outside worlds (some are listed on our Resources page). Read books, watch news and documentaries, and listen to podcasts about the struggle incarcerated people and people reintegrating into society face. Remember to be intersectional in your activism, conscious of the overlapping struggles of being imprisoned with being Black, Latinx, transgender, non-straight, and other marginalized identities. Call your representatives in support of reforms; speak out against the death penalty; support an end to cash bail; oppose for-profit prisons, e-readers, and communications; and resist the erasure of our brethren on the inside.</p>
		<p>Our list of <a href="/resources#critical-prison-resources">critical prison resources</a> is intended to provide a primer on understanding and changing the United States' system of mass incarceration.</p>
